# The Kronos Incident: Geospatial-Temporal Patterns of Life Analysis
Describe common daily routines for GASTech employees and identify up to twelve unusual events or patterns in the data.

## INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE OF THE ANALYSIS
GAStech has been breaking news headlines for being a prestigious company in the energy sector and has recently gained recognition after their initial public offering and successful business model. Now they are breaking news headlines for a different reason. Employees are devastated to find out that some of their coworkers have been kidnapped in an unfortunate turn of events. Two data scientists have been hired to help law enforcement discover unusual patterns of behavior to assist in their investigation of trying to identify what happened during what people are calling ‘The Kronos Incident.’ 

The data scientist researchers were provided with some background information on the employees. GAStech employees had the opportunity to have company cars that they could use for both business and personal occasions. The company cars provided employees an opportunity to have a car that they otherwise may not have been able to afford. The employees who were not assigned a car still had the opportunity to check out company trucks for business use, but the trucks could not be used for personal occasions. GAStech did not trust employees with the vehicles, so the company cars and trucks had geospatial tracking devices that periodically collected data when the vehicles were moving. Employees were unaware of these devices. Employees also had credit cards and loyalty cards which could be used for both personal and business transactions. Loyalty cards were cards where employees could gain rewards and discounts at their favorite local businesses.


## DATA DESCRIPTION - *[Download](https://github.com/emmanueliarussi/DataScienceCapstone/tree/master/7_FinalProjects/TheKronosIncidentGeospatial/data/task2.zip)*
To help the investigation, the researchers were given four main files of information. One file contained employee information including car assignment id, employee name and id, department, and title. Two files contained all the card data, one for the credit cards and another for the loyalty cards. Within the card data, the data fields included name, location, price, and the timestamp. The last file included geospatial data that had the car id, timestamp, latitude, and longitude coordinates. Geospatial ESRI shapefiles were provided with images of both Kronos and Abila, Kronos’ capital where the employees resided. Lastly, a tourist map with business locations and areas of interest was also supplied to the data scientists. 

## DATA PREPARATION 
Data preparation came with a myriad of challenges. The first task was to align the GPS data with the shapefiles and the map with identified points of interest. The data was organized in an interactive map, where researchers could filter the name of the employee, what route they took, the time of day, and if the employee made any stops along their route. However, it was noted that GPS data points were sometimes missing or did not provide the full picture of the locations. For example, GPS data for Axel Calzas often showed spotty locations like in the image below.

#### 1.  Describe common daily routines for GAStech employees. What does a day in the life of a typical GAStech employee look like? 

#### 2. Identify up to twelve unusual events or patterns that you see in the data. If you identify more than twelve patterns during your analysis, focus your answer on the patterns you consider to be most important for further investigation to help find the missing staff members. For each pattern or event you identify, describe
  1. What is the pattern or event you observe?
  2. Who is involved?
  3. What locations are involved?
  4. When does the pattern or event take place?
  5. Why is this pattern or event significant?
  6. What is your level of confidence about this pattern or event? Why?

#### 3. Like most datasets, the data you were provided is imperfect, with possible issues such as missing data, conflicting data, data of varying resolutions, outliers, or other kinds of confusing data. Considering data is primarily spatiotemporal, describe how you identified and addressed the uncertainties and conflicts inherent in this data to reach your conclusions in questions 1 and 2.

In order to use this data, you will require skills in geospatial-temporal analysis, along with the ability to combine various types of data in sensible ways. The GPS data was extracted from the cars for the two weeks period prior to the kidnapping, but not including the kidnapping day itself.  GASTech also issued company debit/credit cards that could be used for personal spending, and many employees had loyalty cards for restaurants and shops around Abila city. Analyzing the combined data sources could reveal clues about the kidnapping and the GASTech employees who may have participated in this activity.  You need to be aware that some GPS readings may be skewed for some vehicles. In addition, particular locations may exhibit deviations in the times at which they post their card transactions. Similarly, in some cases, the transactions were logged in batches once per day; in some locations transactions may be delayed, creating the appearance of individuals shopping in the middle of the night. 

Focus your work on identifying regular patterns. For example, credit card data may contain typical charges like GASTech employees preferring to use their debit and loyalty cards at coffee houses. Deviations from these patterns might indicate suspicious activities or just non-conforming patterns by individuals. Hypotheses about suspicious activities need to be supported by evidence and/or reasoning from data. Look for anomalies such as a credit card charge occurring for an employee while the GPS track indicates a different location for their assigned vehicle. 

Map data, including shape files of Abila city streets and a visitor’s map of the city sites and shops, are provided to you as an additional support to understand patterns of life. For example, even though employees’ home addresses were not provided, patterns of life analysis may reveal where they spent their evening hours, typically indicating their home address. Regular gatherings at what appeared to be residences, but not corresponding to any employee’s home address could suggest different hypotheses.
